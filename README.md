- 👋 Hi, I’m @duaaEng
- 👀 I’m interested in programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning many programming languages
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Open source projects or learning opportunities in [programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, etc.)]. As a beginner, I’m eager to learn from experienced developers and work on diverse projects to improve my skills. If you have a project that matches my level or if you’re interested in working with someone who is enthusiastic about learning and growing, I’d love to be part of your team!
